Hi! I’m Deb, the heart behind Thermie and The BCrew – where delicious cooking meets the open road. With my trusty Thermomix and my little crew by my side, we’re slow-travelling Australia in true gypsy style, chasing sunsets, campfires, and great food.

The BCrew? That’s me, my partner Julian, and our son Nate – a family with a love for freedom, flavour, and the kind of moments that come from living simply and cooking well.

Whether we’re parked up by the beach or tucked away in the bush, you’ll find me creating nourishing, feel-good meals and sharing them with anyone who wants to learn. I offer live demos, road trip–friendly recipes, and real support – because I’m not just here to sell you a Thermomix… I’m here for the long haul, wherever the road takes us.

🛻🏕️🌿
So follow along for food, freedom, and a sprinkle of caravan chaos. And if you spot The BCrew license plate out there – don’t be shy, come say hi!
